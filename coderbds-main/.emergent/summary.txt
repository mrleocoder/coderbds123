The previous AI engineer effectively navigated a complex set of product requirements, iteratively enhancing a full-stack real estate application. The trajectory showcases a systematic approach to debugging and feature implementation, often broken down into logical groups of related tasks. Key challenges included persistent browser caching issues requiring external troubleshoot assistance, ensuring real-time data synchronization between frontend and backend after CRUD operations, and correctly handling authentication and API endpoints. Significant additions include a robust image upload/preview system, a WYSIWYG editor for content, and refined messaging and approval workflows. The engineer diligently addressed user feedback, adapting to specific requests like dynamic site settings and responsive UI, concluding with 11 out of 17 reported issues successfully resolved and the focus shifting to member post approval synchronization.

The application is a comprehensive, responsive real estate platform featuring core property and news management via an admin panel. It expanded from basic pagination to a full ecosystem encompassing client-side/admin data synchronization, real-time admin dashboard analytics, a customer support ticket system, user registration/authentication, member post creation, a wallet with deposit functionalities, and admin content/deposit approvals. Recent requirements included granular control over site settings (company info, bank details, contact links, working hours), advanced image handling (carousel, click-to-enlarge), a direct admin-member chat, and the implementation of a WYSIWYG editor for rich text content. Critical fixes involve ensuring data consistency between admin actions and member views, correcting form submission logic, and unifying notification systems to use toasts.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had just completed a significant batch of fixes across multiple areas. The primary focus involved addressing critical backend and frontend synchronization issues. Specifically, the engineer confirmed that admin dashboard data was loading correctly on the preview environment, fixed bank information synchronization from admin settings to the member dashboard, corrected deposit approval status logic, enabled member post edit/delete functionality with modal forms, and resolved general admin save errors for News, Property, and Land content by integrating ReactQuill WYSIWYG editor. Furthermore, the messaging system was overhauled to support distinct system and private messages with pagination, and all frontend  notifications were replaced with  messages. The image upload functionality was enhanced to include immediate previews with delete options across relevant forms, and image carousels with click-to-enlarge were implemented for property and land detail pages. The last action taken was restarting the frontend service, and the engineer was about to start addressing the Member post approval sync issue (#8) by examining backend endpoints.
